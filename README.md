# BadImplementation
VERY BAD implementation where we break all the coding norms ON PURPOSE

A detail description on what we broke:
- Code is unreadable
- Badly written IF statements
- Useless functions
- Bad names 
- Meaningless names
- No comment at all 
- Also overcommenting
- Make a number that we use once into a constant
- White spaces that break all dimensionality
- No consistency
